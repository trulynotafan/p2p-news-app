# Relay


Relay basically acts as a bridge for the browsers to use the true power of P2P using the hyperswarm.


# Usage


Usage of relay is pretty simple, you will just run the relay via `npm run relay`

The relay is then used as the default relay, that is passed to the identity module to use the web-based applications with hyperswarm
