# LAB

Welcome to LAB, here we can we test different modules, debug different errors in different scenarios.



# browser-demo.js 

This demo is to check the blind-pairing compatibilty with browser and debug issues regarding patch



To test it, first run:


```javascript

npm run relay


```

and then


```javascript

npm run browser-demo 


```
this will run the browser-demo without any patch. You can then apply the patch and see if it works.. And if it's necessary.
